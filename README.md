## Overview ##

This repository will hold all of my solutions to coding puzzles posted on codingame.com. Descriptions of each puzzle will be listed in this readme file in the order in which I completed them.

## Temperatures ##

### The Goal ###
In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.
### Rules ###
Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
### Input ###
Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.
### Output ###
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
